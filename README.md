# An R Shiny demo of Rasch Model Simulations

This is code to build an R Shiny app for creating some simple item response theory (IRT) simulations. The app allows the user to generate distinctive patterns for the test items (easy, hard, bimodal, etc), and illustrates the effects on a few IRT plots.

A live version of the demo can be found here: <https://globalcognition.shinyapps.io/shiny-app-irt-sims/>

Try the following:

-   hard 4, easy 1 (hard test; default)

-   hard 0, easy 0 (bimodal)

-   hard .5, easy .5 (fairly uniform)

-   hard 16, easy 16 (concentrated on middle)

-   hard 16, easy 0 (very difficult)
